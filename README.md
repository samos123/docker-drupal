# Drupal image without database

This image contains the latest stable Drupal 7-release. It will automatically
setup the database and install a default site.

The image doesn't contain a database so you have to create a seperate database
container (which is no effort if you use the provided configuration for
*docker-compose*) and link this container or pass the database information of a
MySQL- or Postgres-host.


## Why create another Drupal image?

Many of the other Drupal images got a database baked in or didn't install
Drupal automatically and didn't offer much flexibility. This image can be
easily be used as base image for your own Drupal images see below Customization
by using Dockerfiles. At the same time you can just use this image for a
vanilla Drupal-experience that can be fully administered and extended via the
web-interface as well as with *drush* on the command-line.


## Usage

If you want to launch a bare Drupal image with a MySQL backend you can do so:

    docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="test123" --name db mysql
    docker run -d --link db:mysql -p 80:80 samos123/drupal

Alternatively you can use [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
in a directory that contains the provided [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/samos123/docker-drupal/blob/master/docker-compose.yml):

    docker-compose up

This will launch a new drupal site with a default theme and no additional
modules. If you want custom modules, see *Customization*.

As customizations and uploads are stored you must take care of these directories
if you want to keep these:
  - `/var/www/html/sites` (modules, themes, uploaded files)
  - `/var/www/private` (non-public files, e.g. to store backups)

As these folders are defined as *volumes* in the sample `docker-compose.yml`,
you can easily update your container to use the latest image while preserving
any modifications with:

    docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d


## Database options

You can use a linked database-container with the alias `mysql` or `postgres` as
shown above - Drupal will be automatically configured to it. Or you use an
external database-host. Therefore pass the following environment variables to
your container:

  - `DB_DRIVER`
    - allowed values are `mysql` (default) and `pgsql`
  - `DB_HOST`
  - `DB_PORT`
    - default: `3306` if `DB_DRIVER` == 'mysql'
    - default: `5432` if `DB_DRIVER` == 'pgsql'
  - `DB_NAME`
    - default: `drupal`
    - default: `postgres` if `DB_DRIVER == pgsql`
  - `DB_USER`
    - default: `root` if `DB_DRIVER` == 'mysql'
    - default: `postgres` if `DB_DRIVER` == 'pgsql'
  - `DB_PASS`

### Postgres

You can alternatively use a Postgres container. The configuration is very
similar to that of MySQL as seen in the `docker-compose.yml` file, with a
couple small changes.

There is an example `docker-compose.yml` available in the [examples folder](https://github.com/samos123/docker-drupal/tree/master/examples/postgres/docker-compose.yml).

## Other options

  - `VIRTUAL_HOST` - sets the `ServerName`-directive for *httpd* and *Drupal*'s
    `base_url` configuration variable; handy in conjunction with
    [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy)
    - if it is a comma-seperated list, the first value is used
  - `SERVERNAME` - use this to explicitly set httpd's `ServerName`-directive
    - if none of these both variables are given, the `/etc/hostname` will be used
  - `BASE_URL` - explicitly set the `base_url` configuration variable for *Drupal*
    - trailing slashes are not allowed
  - `BASE_URL_PROTO` (default: `https://`) - if `BASE_URL` is derived from
    `VIRTUAL_HOST`, this will be prefixed as protocol
  - `UPLOAD_LIMIT` (default: `10M`) - sets variables for the *PHP*-interpreter
    to control maximum upload sizes
  - `MEMORY_LIMIT` (default: `64M`) - sets the [`memory_limit`](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit)
     for the *PHP*-interpreter


## Customization

To create a customized Drupal-image, you can add/modify scripts in a derived
image or mount them in your container into these directories:
`/scripts/setup.d` and `/scripts/pre-launch.d`. Furthermore,

  - the scripts' name must start with two digits, the rest may consist of
    alphanumerics, `_` and `-`
    - the scripts will be executed in alphanumerical order of their names
  - the scripts must be set executable (`chmod a+x <scriptpath>`)

See the [folder examples](https://github.com/samos123/docker-drupal/tree/master/examples/custom-image)
on how to use the *Zen*-template and the *modules_filter*-module and build an
image containing them.

*Drush*'s system-wide configuration (`/etc/drushrc.php`) sets its default-
behaviour to be verbose (`-v`) and affirmative (`--yes`) in order to grant easy
and elaborated usage of scripts. If you want to change that behaviour in an
interactive environment or for certain sites (e.g. `docker exec -ti
<drupal_container> /bin/bash`), change it in an
[overriding `drushrc.php`-location](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drush-ops/drush/master/examples/example.drushrc.php).

See the [documentation of php:apache](https://github.com/docker-library/php/) on
the usage of `docker-php-ext-configure` and `docker-php-ext-install` to install
PHP extensions.
